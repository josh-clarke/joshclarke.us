I'm a freelance UX designer, information architect, and front-end developer. I'm currently traveling and accepting freelance work. **Currently available for hire.**

This is just a placeholder while I get things in order. You’re welcome to browse my older work (4+ years old) at [Transhuman Creative](https://transhumancreative.com) or contact me for examples of more recent work and a résumé [here](mailto:josh@joshclarke.us).
